methods and constr:
----------------------

consr                                                        method
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.constr name = class name                                1. method name can be anything
2.constr is implicit call                                 2.method is a explicit call
3.contr there is no retunn type                           3. there is a return type or void
4.contsr logic has                                        4. method write any logic
only initilizing the instace variables
5.constr is called during obj creation                   5. method should be called after obj creation.





Instance variable                                    static variables                                     local variables
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------
1. inside a class                                1.inside a class with static                            1.inside the method
2.memory  is created during obj creation         2.memory is created during class loading                2. memory is created when method is called
3.memory is created every time when obj          3. memory is created one time                           3.memory is created every time when method is called,
is created
4.memory is deleted when                         4.memory is deleted when prog stops/class is unloaded     4.memory is deleted when method execution is completed
obj is garbage collected. 
5.memory is created in heap                      5. memory is creaed in class area                        5. memory is created in stack
6.access using the object                        6.access using the class name                            6. access within the method 
7.to represent specific data                     7.to represent common data                               7. temporary variables for processing
8.is associated with obj                         8. associated with class                                  8.associated with method

Garbage Collection:
------------------------
- It is a background job that runs for the cleanup of unused data.
- memory de-allocation is taken care by java using GC. 

Memory:
-------------
Heap area  ---------> Objects 
class area  -----------> class info , static info
Stack  ---------------> local variables
