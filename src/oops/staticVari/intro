static variables:
  --------------
  -> static variable is declared inside the class
  ->global variables.
  ->memory is created only one time
  ->static variables are like the common data for all objs
  
  ->
  For instance variables , memory is created every time when obj is created.
  static variables memory is created one time during class loading.
  
  
 
  syntax:
  --------------
  class Person{
    int id; // instance variable
    static int count; // static variable
    
  }
  
  static variables ---> common data for all obj
  inst variables ---> specific data for every obj.
    

  class Student{
    #instance  variables
    int id;
    String name;
    int semNo;
    
    static String colleageName ; //  static variable memory allocated one time
  }
  
 ->we can call static variable as "class variables"
 -> for accessing static variable object is not required, Class name is sufficient.
 -> for accessing instance variable object is required.
  
  Syntax:
  ------------------------------
  #change static variable
  Student.colleageName ="GPR  Engg college";
  
  
  #access static variable
  System.out.println(Student.colleageName)   ;
  
  
  
 #access instance variables by creating obj
    Student s = new Student();
    s.id=2000;
	s.name="kumar";
	s.semNo=3;
		
  ex2:
    
    Person p = new Person
    p.id= 67
    syso(p.id)
    
    
    2.acces static varia
    Person.count =
  
  
static methods:
---------------


public class Person{


	int id;
	static int count;
	
	
	public void show(){
	
	}

   public static void process(){
   
   
   }

}

class: Person
instance variable : id
static variable: count

instance method : show()
static method: process()



if a method has "static" keyword in the method declaration then the method is termed as "static method".

- instance method can be called only by creating the object
- static method can be called without creating the object.

- static method can access only static variables ;
 i.e. from static method we cannot access the instance variables

-  static method can call/access only static methods
 i.e. from static method we cannot call/access  the instance methods.
 
- from the instance methods we can access everything : ( instance variables + instance mthods + static variables +
static methods)


static methods can be called without object creation.
instance methods should be called only after object creation.

static methods can access only static variables,
static methods cannot access instance variables.

to operate on instance variable we need instance methods.
to operate on static variables we need static methods.

 instance methods -> set/read/process data for instance variables
  static  methods -> set/read/process data for static variables
  
  
syntax for writing a static method:
--------------------------
public class Data{
 
    //static method
    public static void showCount(){
	 			 // some logic
		}
	
		//instance method
		public  void display(){
	 			 // some logic
		}
  
}
  

 call the static method:
-----------------------------------------------------------
//static methods should be called using class name.
Data.showCount();
 

call instance method
-------------------------------------------------------------
Data d = new Data();
d.display();
