package inherit.multilevelConstr;

/* 
Person has id,name, age
Employee has id,name, age , pan , pf
Staff has id,name, age , pan , pf , contractId , contractPeriod.

solution:
Person is the parent class for Employee.
Employee is the parent class for Staff. 


Staff class will get inheritance from Person and Employee.

Person constructor has 3 args.
Employee constructor has 5 args ,  from employee constr call the  Person constr ..
Staff constructor has 7 args , from Staff constr call the employee constr..

create the objs , set data and print.
